v1.1.0   (1st June 2008)

  * Added data structures:
     - Binary Heap
     - Binomial Heap
     - Bloom Filter
  * Iterator functions changed to a model based around an iterator structure
    rather than callback functions.
  * Void pointers used for keys/values replaced by typedefs to void pointers.
    This allows the type to be changed to something else if desired.
  * Hash table sizes changed to use a set of recommended prime numbers
    that are mathematically good for use in hash tables:

  * Tests added for some code that was not covered by the test suite.
  * Failed malloc() calls are now checked for.
  * Bugs fixed:
    - Lockup with set_remove function.
    - set_to_array did not include all values.
